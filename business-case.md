# A blockchain solution for the chocolate supply chain

## The problem

The global chocolate industry is valued at $130 billion, yet only 6.6% of each chocolate bar sale goes 
to cocoa farmers. On average, cocoa farmers earn profits between $1,400 and $2,000 per year, 
which at most comes down to $5 a day. Each farmer is the sole provider for 6-10 dependants, 
which means that on an individual level each person is living below the World Bank poverty line of $1.25 a day.


Many efforts have been made to improve this state of inequity, by ensuring minimum price 
levels and requiring certifications, but with limited impact. According to one study of Ghanaian cocoa farmers, 
there was no significant difference in income between Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers. The problem, then, does
not seem to be due to a lack of regulation. Instead, a major pain point for farmers is the inability to 
transfer production costs down stream. Due to regulation and a scarcity of sales channels, farmers are forced
to offer prices set by the market. 

Another problem in the chocolate industry lies in the product supply chain. In general, each player in the chain
uses different bookkeeping systems. Some, as is common in the shipping industry, are even still largely paper-based.
This structure is inevitably error-prone and opaque and allows for black or grey-market products to enter 
the mainstream.

Lastly, consumers today are increasingly concerned about the provenance of their purchases and are 
willing to pay up to 30% more for that service. John West, a global producer of canned fish, made an additional
$22 million in revenue when it started to print codes on their packaging which allowed users to trace the fish
back to the primary fisherman. Implementing such a system correctly, however, can be costly and difficult.

## The solution

Blockchain is a proven technology for fair and safe online transactions, giving users complete control over their
selling prices and terms. Therefore, a safe and simple to use blockchain-based transaction service gives cocoa farmers
the freedom to set their own prices and eliminates any transaction costs usually required by bank-based
currency transfers. Furthermore, this service would eliminate various inefficiencies, redundancies, and costs
at all stages of the supply chain. Finally, this innovation could boost the market size as consumers increase
their willingness-to-pay for more sustainable and fair products.

In order to demonstrate the potential impact of this technology, we have constructed a blockchain for the 
chocolate supply chain.
